I was born in 1987 in Nyköping, Sweden. From age 4, I live in the
Netherlands where I grew up in Brabant. In 2005, I moved to Arnhem to
study Nutrition and Dietetics in Nijmegen. After a year, I made the step
to Wageningen University where I studied Health and Society. In 2012, I
started my career as a researcher in the field of public mental health.

Beside my work, I have various other interests including cooking,
interior design and modern art. I love being creative. In my spare time,
I am often busy sketching, drawing or painting.

Via artistic imagery, I try to exhibit nature and human life. I paint
with acrylics on canvas. My paintings are modern, abstract, simplistic,
and have a strong graphic nature. I am inspired by famous artists such
as Escher and Picasso, but my inspiration can come from anywhere. A
conversation, a photo, a book.

With my work, I aim to evoke emotions, creativity and inspiration. I
believe art is the ultimate drug in depressing times. My motto: Art
brings colour into your life!
